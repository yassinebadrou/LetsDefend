Q1:
try to find Event ID 1 related to Process creation.
in this example:
1. The user (Gabr) executed sha256sum.exe to calculate the hash of IDM.exe from the Desktop folder.
2. The parent process was a cmd.exe instance launched via Cmder.
3. The presence of hash values (MD5, SHA256, IMPHASH) suggests this file may be undergoing verification or analysis.
4. If this event was unexpected or unauthorized, it could indicate suspicious behavior, such as file enumeration or hash computation by malware.

Q2:
answer : fodhelper.exe
fodhelper.exe is a trusted executable signed by Microsoft and is designed to run with auto-elevated privileges.
This means that when it is executed, it bypasses the User Account Control (UAC) prompt and runs with administrative rights, making it a target for attackers aiming to perform UAC bypasses.
